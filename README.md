# Pure Latest Tweets 
#### Wordpress widget

A simple Wordpress widget that loads the latest tweets for the specified Twitter account. No iFrame, no styles, just the tweets themselves. 

As opposed to the widget Twitter provides, this one can easily be customized and styled to your liking and to match the design of your Wordpress site.

## Usage

Simply include the file in functions.php

`include('library/pure_latest_tweets.php');`

Enable the widget in the Wordpress admin interface, fill in the necessary fields, save and enjoy! :)
